**OBJECTIVE:**
This project originates from a case study where a College Athletics Department seeks a go-to-market strategy to sell
the naming rights of their football stadium.
The assignment required an evaluation of the market value for these rights, identification of potential corporate partners,
and an analysis of why these entities would benefit from the partnership.
For this project, I aimed to introduce a new valuation methodology for naming rights in the sports industry. Traditionally,
valuations are conducted using regression models; however, I wanted to enhance this approach by incorporating machine 
learning models.

**CONCLUSION:** 
The proposed methodology produced results comparable to those obtained manually using Excel-based regression analysis. 
The key advantage of using machine learning is that it significantly reduces time spent on analysis and allows for 
continuous improvement by integrating additional features as more data becomes available—without altering the core code. 
This makes the model scalable and adaptable.

Report Requirements:
1.Develop and detail an analytical framework to assess the naming rights' value.
2.Provide a concise recommendation of potential partners and sponsorship categories, highlighting the mutual benefits
of these partnerships.

VALUATION METHODOLOGY

My school of choice was Clemson University, and the final valuation was derived using a combination of machine learning 
models.
I utilized viewership data along with additional factors such as the school’s city population and stadium capacity. 
The data was aggregated by team, but given the high collinearity among variables, I tested several models to determine
the most relevant features for the final prediction model. The best-performing model for feature selection was 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which reduces the number of variables while retaining the most critical information. 
Essentially, it identifies the variables that explain the greatest variance in the final outcome.

Once the key features were selected, I proceeded with the predictions.
The model that generated the best results was Gradient Boosting, an ensemble learning technique that begins with a weak 
model with minimal predictive power. It iteratively adds models to correct residual errors, gradually enhancing the overall 
predictive accuracy. The model aggregates predictions from multiple weak learners using weighted averaging. Gradient Boosting 
achieved the lowest mean squared error (MSE), making it the most effective model for this project.

POTENTIAL SPONSOR METHODOLOGY
To identify potential sponsors, I applied various filtering techniques and clustering methods to group similar companies.
Initially, I used Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN), which effectively identifies subgroups even within similar companies. 
This method handles outliers and noise in the data and does not require predefining the number of clusters.

The filtering criteria included:

Location: Preference was given to local companies within the Greenville, Anderson, and Spartanburg areas.
Revenue: Companies with annual revenue exceeding $100M were prioritized.
Industry: Focused on industries commonly involved in stadium naming rights deals across Division 1 athletics.
Alumni Presence: Evaluated the number of Clemson alumni employed at these companies to assess their potential fit.
