**OBJECTIVE:**  
The goal of this project was to analyze college basketball statistics to understand the factors influencing the number
of fouls and free throws. The original Excel spreadsheet was connected to an API providing real-time stats; however, since 
access to the API is no longer available, the current version is connected to an extracted Excel file. The spreadsheet 
includes macros and Power Query formulas to assist with visualization. Users can toggle between different stats and compare 
metrics across teams, conferences, conference games, non-conference games, and all games.  

The client specifically requested an analysis to identify what was driving the low number of fouls and free throws for 
their school. The project aimed to explore relationships between various statistical factors and answer key questions such 
as:  
- Does possession impact the number of fouls?  
- Does a higher number of three-point shot attempts result in fewer free throws?  

**PROJECT FILES:** 
1. Excel Spreadsheet â€“ Contains macros and Power Query formulas to facilitate data visualization and comparison across 
various categories.  

**CONCLUSION:**  
The analysis concluded that the low number of fouls and free throws was primarily due to the team's style of play rather
than any specific statistic such as three-point shooting or possession. Using a Power BI dashboard, we generated 
interactive graphs that allowed users to toggle between different stats and observe their relationships. No strong 
correlation was found between free throws and any single statistic; instead, the findings suggested that the low free 
throw numbers were a result of a combination of factors that define the team's playing style.
