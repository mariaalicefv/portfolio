This project had the goal to analyze the stats in college basketball
The original excel was connected to the API providing the stats -since I don't have access to it anymore, this one is connected
to an excel file extracted from the API. 
The spreadsheet includes macros and Power Querry formulas to assist with visualization and the user can toggle between 
different stats and see the difference between teams, conferences, conference games, non-conference games and all games
