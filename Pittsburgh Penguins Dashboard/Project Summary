In this folder, I am showcasing two dashboards I developed during my Business Intelligence internship with the Pittsburgh Penguins.
Please note that due to compliance, numbers and names on the dashboards cannot be shared. Therefore, a PDF file is provided instead of the actual dashboard.

**OBJETIVE:**
The objective of these dashboards was to facilitate easier visualization and management of key data points, ensuring they remain easy to update and analyze. 
Both dashboards are interactive and were refreshed on a monthly or bi-weekly basis.
Data was extracted from the team's database using SQL queries and Excel reports.

- Blinkfire Dashboard
The goal of this dashboard was to analyze fan engagement on social media. Specifically, it aimed to better understand the value that each post brings to the teamâ€™s
sponsors.
Insights from this dashboard allow the partnerships team to negotiate contracts based on the value the team delivers to each brand.
The dashboard consists of multiple pages analyzing social media performance by platform, post type (e.g., videos, images, reels), and brand.
Key metrics analyzed include the number of posts, impressions, likes, comments, valuation, and more.
This dashboard helps the team identify which types of posts generate higher engagement and deliver greater value, informing content strategies and sponsorship 
negotiations.

- Aging Trial Balance Dashboard
The objective of this dashboard was to provide a clear visualization of outstanding balances by partner, invoice aging by brand, collector, and dollar amount.
This tool helps the department track receivables more efficiently and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) at both the brand and collector levels.
