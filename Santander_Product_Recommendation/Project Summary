This project is based on the dataset from the Santander Kaggle competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/overview

The code and reports are based on the requirements from one of my classes -the biggest one was the need to reduce the dataset to a dataset of less than 1GB.

sandanter_1: Load and Transform the data; NA values treatment; split dataset into train and test
santander_2: EDA 
santander_3: Data Processing; categorical values; feature engineering
santander_4: Modeling approach; Feature Importance Analysis; LIME example
