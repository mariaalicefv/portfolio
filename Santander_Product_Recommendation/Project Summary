**OBJECTIVE:**  
This project is based on the dataset from the Santander Kaggle competition 
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/overview). Santander Bank’s recommendation system 
currently faces inefficiencies, such as irrelevant recommendations and overlooked customer needs, resulting in 
low engagement and lost revenue opportunities.  

The primary goal of this project was to develop a machine learning-based personalized product recommendation 
system to predict the likelihood of customers purchasing specific financial products. The system aimed to:  
1. Provide customers with relevant product suggestions tailored to their unique profiles and needs.  
2. Help Santander improve product adoption rates by focusing marketing efforts on the most likely prospects.  

**PROJECT FILES:**  
1. Python Notebooks: 
   - `santander_1.ipynb`: Data loading, transformation, missing values treatment, and train-test split.  
   - `santander_2.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
   - `santander_3.ipynb`: Data processing, categorical value handling, and feature engineering.  
   - `santander_4.ipynb`: Modeling approach, feature importance analysis, and LIME interpretability example.  

2. Final Project Report:
   - A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, dataset, and results.  

**CONCLUSION:**  
This project highlights the value of machine learning in revolutionizing Santander’s product recommendation 
strategy. By leveraging customer data and predictive analytics, the bank can offer personalized suggestions, 
enhancing customer experience and driving substantial revenue growth.
The ensemble model achieved the best performance.

Key outcomes include:  
- Revenue Growth Potential: The final model has the potential to increase annual revenue by $20 million 
through improved product targeting.  
- Actionable Insights: The model identifies the top three most probable products for each customer, enabling
targeted marketing campaigns with higher conversion rates.  
- Practical Implementation: After deployment, continuous evaluation of the model's performance would be required
to fine-tune recommendations and assess accuracy.  
- Business Value:
  - Customer-Centric Growth: Personalized recommendations enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty by offering
tailored suggestions instead of generic ones.  
  - Operational Efficiency: Automating the recommendation process reduces manual efforts and saves labor hours.  
  - Strategic Insights: The recommendation system serves as a powerful tool to better understand customer behavior 
and preferences.
